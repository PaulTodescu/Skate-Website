      <p>The ollie is a skateboarding trick where the rider and board leap into the air without the use of the rider's hands. It is the combination of stomping, also known as popping, the tail of the skateboard off of the ground to get the board mostly vertical, jumping, and sliding the front foot forward to level out the skateboard at the peak of the jump. Gravity does the rest of the work.

         The ollie is a fundamental skill in skateboarding. Ollies are necessary to leap onto, over, or off of obstacles. As most flip tricks depend on it, the ollie is often the first skill to be learned by a new skateboarder, therefore it typically takes considerable practice to learn.</p>

      <p>A Backside 180 Ollie is an Ollie with a 180 degree turn but where the body and board move in a backward motion with the back of your body exposing first as you do the turn, hence the name “Backside”. This is the opposite direction and motion of the Frontside 180 Ollie. This are the first tricks that require both your board and your body to turn in a certain direction, which is an important skill in skateboarding.</p>

      <p>The kickflip is a maneuver in skateboarding in which the rider flips their skateboard 360° along the axis that extends from the nose to the tail of the deck. When the rider is regular footed the board spins counter-clockwise if viewed from the back.

         It was the first of many modern flip tricks to be invented or modified by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s. The original kickflip was invented by pioneer Curt Lindgren prior to 1978 and was later modified and popularized by Mullen. In March 2011, the first kickflip in surfing was landed by Zoltan "The Magician" Torkos.[1] Torkos's feat was widely criticized and remains disputed as to whether or not it traveled up and off the lip of the wave.</p>

    <div class="boxright">
      <p>The heelflip (a.k.a. heel or heelie), is an aerial skateboarding trick where the skateboarder kicks out in front of him/her flipping board 360 degrees along the board's long axis.

         A heelflip is executed similarly to the ollie, and like the ollie has become a defining trick of "New School" skateboarding. 
         A heelflip is the opposite of a kickflip, as the board spins towards the toes. For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.</p>

   <div class="boxcenter">
      <p>A Shove-it (or shuvit) is a skateboarding trick where the skateboarder makes the board spin 180 degrees without the tail of the board hitting the ground under their feet. There are many variations of the shove-it but they all follow the same principle: The skateboarder's lead foot remains in one spot, while the back foot performs the "shove". The pop shove-it was originally called a "Ty hop", named after Ty Page. 
         A pop shove-it starts like an ollie, as the skateboarder jumps and kicks the tail of the board down to make the board airborne.
